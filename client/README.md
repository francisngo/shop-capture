# Capture - A Marketplace for Photographers & Filmmakers

Capture is a marketplace for cameras, lenses, bags, lighting & more.
It is an online e-commerce web application built on React/TypeScript, Firebase Auth & Firestore, Redux Saga, React Router, and Styled Components. 

This is a project in process to practice and apply new learnings during my unemployment journey. This is not an official e-commerce website. 

Why Redux Saga? 

To handle asynchronous operations such as making API calls, handling side effects, and managing data flow. It provides a way to write and manage async logic as a series of generators, which can be easier to reason about and test compared to traditional promise-based approaches.
